# rdbsync
### a quick and dirty ruby script to sync remote db via ftp for (php) web projects

It's common to keep local db in sync w/ production one
if you're tired of one of these: 
* working with php cms (who doesn't have to, sometimes...) and deal with db upload/download on remote hosting services 
* open (awful and chunky) hosting web interfaces to deal w/ remote db(s)
* launch local mysql client app or run commands to restore db, and do it repetitively

this tool is for you...
Right now, it only implements download and local restore of db (get)

## usage
* git clone git@github.com:magnum/rdbsync.git
* copy rdbsync.example.yml from the cloned dir your web project directory, save as rdbsync.yml and edit accordingly
* use it

`ruby $HOME/projects/rdbsync/rdbsync`

## next steps
* local dump and remote restore (put)
* testing routine

Help or suggestions are appreciated
